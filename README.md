I'm Jorge, although online I go by the name 'robtzcraft'. I'm an enthusiast of programming and robotics... 
I navigate the world with the humor of a young child. I'm always looking for new and interesting challenges to professionally procrastinate on.

I also enjoy playing videogames and playing guitar alonside another musical instruments.
